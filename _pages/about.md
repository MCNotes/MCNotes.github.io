## The basics

MC Notes is a **literate programming** friendly journal for researchers carrying out intensive data analysis or computational research in any application domain.
It allows authors to combine their analysis scripts with the method documentation in a **single submission**, thereby making the reproduction, extension, and replicability
of the presented approach more accessible to the scientific community.

MC Notes has a formal peer review process designed to improve the scientific
submission and review processes.
It also aims to improve and promote scientific reproducibility and replicability
by making use of technologies such as Jupyter notebooks for the presentation
of data analyses and results as well as Continuous Integration, version control, and
testing along the entire submission process.

## How is this journal _friendly_?

MC Notes is an open source journal for the publication of research outputs
along with the the computational pipeline used to obtain such results. It is
designed to encourage open research while making it easy to create informative yet engaging
scientific publications.

The whole submission process simple and completely open. All of this workflow
is carried on GitHub where the journal editors, the reviewers, and the authors can openly track the process, and interact among them in an open and respectful way.

The journal has a rigorous peer review process and a growing editorial board formed by highly experienced researchers and research software engineers (RSEs).

## Code of conduct
The MC Notes community (editorial board, developers, authors, reviewers, and readers) adheres to a code of conduct adapted from the [Contibutor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org)

Both authors and reviewers will have to confirm that they have read our [code of conduct]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _pages/CoC.md %}),
and are expected to adhere to it.
