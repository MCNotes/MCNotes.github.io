[Project Jupyter](http://blog.jupyter.org/2017/04/04/jupyter-notebook-5-0/)
currently provides support for over 80 kernels.
You are welcome to use your preferred one for your submission.
Please make sure you include the appropriate kernel information along with your metadata
(see below).

**Python users**: The latest version of the Jupyter notebooks only
provides support for Python 3, hence those submitting notebooks using the Python kernel must
ensure Python 3.x is used.
